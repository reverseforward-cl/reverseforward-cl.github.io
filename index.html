            Our novel reverse forward curriculum learning (RFCL) algorithm
            achieves much
            <strong>higher sample and demonstration efficiency</strong> compared
            to other model-free baselines, in addition to solving previously
            unsolvable tasks (like PegInsertionSide and PlugCharger) from just
            1-10 demonstrations and sparse rewards without much hyperparameter
            tuning.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p class="abstract">
          Reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising framework to
          autonomously learn policies through environment interaction to solve
          tasks, but often requires an infeasible amount of interaction data to
          solve complex tasks from sparse rewards. One direction has been to
          augment RL with offline data demonstrating how to solve the desired
          task, but past work in this area often require a lot of high quality
          demonstration data that is difficult to obtain especially for domains
          such as robotics. Our approach consists of a two-stage training
          process starting with a reverse curriculum followed by a forward
          curriculum. Unique to our approach compared to past work is the
          ability to efficiently leverage more than one demonstration
          efficiently via a per-demonstration reverse curriculum generated via
          state resets. The result of our reverse curriculum is an initial
          policy that performs well on a narrow initial state distribution and
          helps overcome difficult exploration problems. A forward curriculum is
          then used to accelerate the training of the initial policy to perform
          well on the full initial state distribution of the task and helps
          improve demonstration and sample efficiency. We show how the
          combination of a reverse curriculum and forward curriculum in our
          method, RFCL, enables significant improvements on demonstration and
          sample efficiency comparing against various state-of-the-art
          learning-from-demonstration baselines, even solving previously
          unsolvable tasks that require high precision and control.

          On the left is the per-demonstration reverse curriculum, which starts
          by prioritizing initial states from the demonstration that are close
          to the goal, which are likely to yield sparse reward signals. The
          reverse curriculum gradually increases the difficulty by initializing
          the agent to earlier states in each demonstration which are farther
          away from goal. The result is a specialist policy capable of solving
          the desired task from a narrow initial state distribution marked by
          the dashed green lines. Note that some demonstrations are
          "reverse-solved" earlier and this arises as a result of our
          per-demonstration reverse curriculum which through ablations is shown
          to be more efficient than alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right is the forward curriculum that is a simple adaption of
          Prioritized Level Replay, which always prioritizes initial states not
          from the demonstration, but from the original task that have high
          learning potential. Learning potential is computed as a sum of a score
          and a staleness weight. The score we assign an initial state is either
          1, 2 or 3 based on the current policy's performance starting from that
          state. We assign 1 if the initial state frequently receives nonzero
          return, 2 if the initial state always receives zero return, and 3 if
          the initial state sometimes receives nonzero return. The staleness
          score further ensures we occasionally revisit previously seen initial
          states and update the score appropriately. By prioritizing initial
          states with high score + staleness, we frequently sample initial
          states that have "signs of life," and aggressively sample them until
          the agent can capably achieve high return from these initial states.
          In general we observe that inital states with signs of life tend to be
          close to the set of states from whch the policy is already achieving
          high return on. Over the course of training, the forward curriculum
          enables the initially weak policy to efficiently generalize to a much
          larger initial state distribution.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            We rigorously evaluate RFCL against several baselines, including
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02948" target="_blank">RLPD</a>
            (state-of-the-art on Adroit at the time of writing),
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05479" target="_blank"
              >Cal-QL</a
            >
            (state-of-the-art offline-to-online RL),
            <a href="https://jumpstart-rl.github.io/" target="_blank">JSRL</a>
            (recent reverse curriculum method), and
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10087">DAPG</a> (demonstration
            augmented policy gradient). We benchmark across 22 tasks, with 3
            from Adroit, 15 from MetaWorld, and 4 from ManiSkill2.
          </p>
          <img src="./public/figures/figure_main.png" />
          <p>
            The main results show the algorithm performance over time when using
            sparse rewards and just 5 demonstrations. The shaded area shows the
            95% confidence intervals over 5 seeds averaged across each task in
            each of the three suites. RFCL significantly outperforms prior
            methods. This is especially evident on harder tasks like
            PegInsertionSide and PlugCharger from ManiSkill2, which are more
            difficult due to their high initial state randomization and precise
            manipulation requirements, see the
            <a href="#task-visuals-a">visualizations</a> to see it visually.
          </p>
          <h3>Demonstration Ablations</h3>
          <img src="./public/figures/figure_demo_ablation.png" />
          <p>
            We've seen the sample efficency earlier, to get a sense of the
            demonstration efficiency we ablate on the number of demonstrations
            given during training on the ManiSkill2 tasks. We benchmark on
            ManiSkill2 as they are the most realistic tasks (high initial state
            randomization, higher fidelity simulation). Our method RFCL again
            significantly outperforms baselines in terms of demonstration
            efficiency, being capable of solving environments from as little as
            1 demonstration! Critically, we observe that the forward curriculum
            is most helpful in the low demonstration regime, which can be
            attributed to the fact that with fewer demonstrations, the reverse
            curriculum trained policy is succesful on a even narrow set of
            initial states, meaning initial state prioritization from the
            forward curriculum is more crucial.
          </p>

          <h3>Curriculum Ablations</h3>

          </div>
          <p>
            Above is an animation of the success rate heatmap on a pointmaze
            which shows how the reverse forward curriculum improves the agent
            over time compared to using only a forward curriculum or no
            curriculum. <span style="color: blue">Blue line</span> is the
            demonstration heading to the
            <span style="color: red">red goal.</span> To mimic hard exploration
            problems in robotics tasks, this pointmaze is modified so that the
            agent can only reset to states not covered by the demonstration, and
            it may not collide with the walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reverse curriculum enables very quick solving of the difficult exploration portion of the maze along the demonstration, before leveraging the forward curriculum to then generalize to other initial states.
